Quay - Redhat openshift registry -> https://docs.projectquay.io/welcome.html

Red Hat OpenShift Quay refers to the integration and use of Red Hat Quay with Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.
Red Hat Quay is an enterprise-grade, distributed, and highly available container image registry. It provides secure storage, distribution, and management of container images and other cloud-native artifacts. 

**Key features include:
****Image Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrates with Clair for vulnerability analysis of container images.
**Access Controls and Governance:** Offers granular permissions and management for repositories and content.
**Geo-replication and Repository Mirroring:** Enables global distribution and high availability of images.
**CI/CD Integration:** Facilitates automated builds and deployments with tools like GitHub and GitLab.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is an enterprise Kubernetes platform that enables organizations to develop, deploy, and manage containerized applications.
When used together, Red Hat Quay serves as a central, secure, and robust container image registry for applications running on OpenShift. This integration streamlines the development and deployment workflow by providing a single source of truth for container images, enhancing security through vulnerability scanning, and simplifying image management within the OpenShift environment. You can deploy Red Hat Quay on OpenShift using its dedicated Operator, which automates the installation and management of the registry within the cluster.
